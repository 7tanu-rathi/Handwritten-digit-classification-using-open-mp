# Handwritten-digit-classification-using-open-mp

This project has been implemented using nueral networks with one hidden layer. We have used MNIST dataset for training and testing. Sequential implementation was taking too much time and on parallelising using open-mp the time required reduced drastically. A plot of the time taken on various epochs has been included.
